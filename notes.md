NOTES

7/30/2025
Realistic goal: Finish writing the member functions census() and populate() in the grid class.
Target goal: Begin to create tests for the game of life.
Stretch goal: Finish the game of life.

I finished the realistic goal. I'm surprised. It's far past my bed time at the moment but I'm proud, even if the census member function looks insane at the moment. That will be fixed next time.


7/29/2025
Realistic goal: Finish writing the grid class and the cell class.
Target goal: Complete research on which library to use to animate the game of life. 
Stretch goal: Animate the game of life using the chosen library.

I did not complete the realistic goal today. So sad :(.
The cell class in grid.h is complete. 
The grid class in grid.h is almost complete. I finished writing the constructor and the print function but I wasn't able to start writing the populate or census functions.
