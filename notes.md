Realistic goal: Finish writing the grid class and the cell class.
Target goal: Complete research on which library to use to animate the game of life. 
Stretch goal: Animate the game of life using the chosen library.

I did not complete the realistic goal today. So sad :(.
The cell class in grid.h is complete. 
The grid class in grid.h is almost complete. I finished writing the constructor and the print function but I wasn't able to start writing the populate or census functions.
