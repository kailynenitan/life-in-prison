NOTES
8/10/2025
Realistic goal: Finish researching the FTXUI library and start creating a plan on how to use it in the program.
Target goal: Finish writing pseudocode for the code from the FTXUI library.
Stretch goal: Complete the game of life.

I'm finally doing some of the research for how to animate the game of life in the terminal. I used ncurses in my college courses because I was programming in C at the time but, I guess I'm supposed to be using the FXTUI library for C++ programs.


8/9/2025
Realistic goal: Research ncurses library and plan how to animate the game of life.
Target goal: Complete the game of life.
Stretch goal: Start creating a plan to implement the prisoner's dilemma into the game of life.

Last time, I completed the makefile and clang-format file. I am using a clang-format file from one of my college courses (CSE13 with Prof. Long from UCSC).


8/6/2025
Realistic goal: Complete makefile and clang-format file.
Target goal: Research ncurses library and plan how to animate the game of life.
Stretch goal: Complete the game of life.

Last time, I didn't do much. Today is a new day for new mistakes to make :).
I learned that I am supposed to put the class definitions for cell and grid in grid.cpp instead of grid.h so I started to work on that and then I got distracted (I started to play video games) and stopped but, I will continue with that today and complete the realistic goal that I have set for myself.


8/3/2025
Realsitic goal: Research ncurses library and plan how to animate the game of life.
Target goal: Complete makefile and clang-format file.
Stretch goal: Complete the game of life.


7/30/2025
Realistic goal: Finish writing the member functions census() and populate() in the grid class.
Target goal: Begin to create tests for the game of life.
Stretch goal: Finish the game of life.

I finished the realistic goal. I'm surprised. It's far past my bed time at the moment but I'm proud, even if the census member function looks insane at the moment. That will be fixed next time.


7/29/2025
Realistic goal: Finish writing the grid class and the cell class.
Target goal: Complete research on which library to use to animate the game of life. 
Stretch goal: Animate the game of life using the chosen library.

I did not complete the realistic goal today. So sad :(.
The cell class in grid.h is complete. 
The grid class in grid.h is almost complete. I finished writing the constructor and the print function but I wasn't able to start writing the populate or census functions.
