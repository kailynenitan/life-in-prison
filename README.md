# (WIP) Life in Prison
by Kailyn Enitan

This project was inspired by a YouTube video by Veritasium called "What Game Theory Reveals About Conflict and War." I learned about the prisoner's dilemma in this video and at the end of the video, it's suggested that in a map where there are nice agents and mean agents playing against each other and converting one another, nice agents would win out. The visual representation in the video of this occurring reminded me a lot of the Game of Life by John Conway so I decided to try to create my own visual representation of this happening. >:)

Life in Prison (Prisoner's Dilemma: To Play the Game of Life?) is my attempt to create an iterated prisoner's dilemma with the game of life.
